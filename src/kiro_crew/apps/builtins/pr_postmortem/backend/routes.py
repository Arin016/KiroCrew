"""HTTP routes for the PR Postmortem builtin app.

Registered at gateway startup from the manifest's ``backend.routes`` field
(``"backend.routes:register_routes"``). ``register_routes`` takes the gateway's
aiohttp Application and registers FULL paths on its router -- the builtin
convention, and different from the external-app AppRoute list.

Every handler is wrapped in ``_require_enabled``: builtin routes are registered at
startup whether or not the app is switched on, so a default-disabled app would
otherwise stay callable.

Read endpoints serve merged report views. The only writes are human decisions --
accept/reject a prevention proposal, or rule that a blame link is wrong. Nothing
here applies a proposal to a repository; that stays an explicit, separate action.
