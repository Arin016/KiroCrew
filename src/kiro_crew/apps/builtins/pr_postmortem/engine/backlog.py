"""Prevention backlog: aggregate proposals across reports, rank by recurrence.

One postmortem produces a plausible suggestion. The same suggestion arriving from
four unrelated fixes is a systemic gap -- that difference is the only reason this
app is worth more than reading the PRs yourself. So proposals are clustered and
ranked by **how many distinct fix PRs** produced them, not by how many proposals
exist (two proposals from one PR must not inflate a cluster).

Clustering is deterministic and dependency-free: same bucket, plus token overlap
(Jaccard) over title and text above a threshold. Cluster ids are seeded from the
earliest member, so a new report joining a cluster does not renumber it and orphan
a recorded application.

Nothing here writes to a repository. ``apply_plan`` only produces the text of a
handoff -- the write itself is performed by an agent, from an explicit click.

#   4. the METHOD -- trusted, how to carry the action out
