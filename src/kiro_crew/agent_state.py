"""Sidecar store for KiroCrew's per-agent bookkeeping.

kiro-cli validates ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` with serde ``deny_unknown_fields``
and rejects the *entire* spec on any unknown key, then silently falls back to
the default agent (``--agent <name>`` resolves to default with only a stderr
"no agent with name X found" line). KiroCrew therefore keeps its private
per-agent bookkeeping OUT of the kiro spec and in this sidecar, so every spec
stays schema-valid for kiro-cli.

Three values are tracked, all kept in this sidecar rather than the kiro spec:

- ``model_managed`` (bool): whether an agent's ``model`` should track the
  shipped ``defaults.json`` (so a default bump propagates) or is an explicit
  user pick frozen against future bumps.
- ``cc_model`` (str): a per-agent model for the ``claude_code`` provider (that
  backend can't pick a per-agent model from ``--agent`` the way kiro-cli does).
- ``config_model`` (str): the model the global ``agent.model`` last propagated
  into this agent's spec, recorded only when that write REPLACED a different
  value. Provenance for the write, so returning the global to "auto" can un-pin
  a spec model Kiro Crew itself wrote. Equality is deliberately not treated as
  provenance: the Agent Templates editor and a hand edit also write the spec, so
  a spec that already agrees with the global may be someone else's pick. The
  accepted cost is that a pin made before this record existed has no provenance
  and is never un-pinned.

  **Obligation for any new writer of a spec's ``model``:** if your write leaves
  the value EQUAL to this record, void the record (``set_config_model(name,
  None)``) after your spec write succeeds — otherwise the un-pin will later read
  your value as the old propagation and replace it with "auto". A write that
  leaves the value DIFFERENT needs nothing: the post-write retirement in
  ``agent._resolve_config_model_record`` clears a spent record on its own.

State file (``~/.kiro/crew/agent_model_state.json``, honoring ``KIROCREW_HOME``)::

    {
      "kirocrew":           {"model_managed": true, "config_model": "<pinned id>"},
      "kirocrew-heartbeat": {"cc_model": "claude-sonnet-4.6"}
    }

This is a near-leaf module: it imports only the stdlib plus the leaf
``config.paths`` and ``atomic_write`` helpers, so it never participates in the
``agent`` <-> ``config.loader`` import cycle.
